        ages when they started walking and talking and what their precise IQ scores were in 
        elementary and high school. In the end, only one thing mattered: family background.
       The As overwhelmingly came from the middle and the upper class. Their homes were filled 
        with books. Half the fathers of the A group had a college degree or beyond, and this at a time when a 
        university education was a rarity. The Cs, on the other hand, were from the other side 
        of the tracks. Almost a third of them had a parent who had dropped out of school before 
        the eighth grade.</text></fragment></target><content><text></text></content></annotation><annotation color="#EE00EE"><target><fragment start="OEBPS/part36.xhtml#point(/1/4/4/28/1:310)" end="OEBPS/part36.xhtml#point(/1/4/4/28/1:1129)"><text>In nineteen eighty, if you went to the Business Roundtable [the association of major 
        American corporate executives] and took surveys about whether hostile takeovers should be 
        allowed, two-thirds would have said no,” Flom said. “Now, the vote would be almost 
        unanimously yes.” Companies needed to be defended against lawsuits from rivals. Hostile 
        suitors needed to be beaten back. Investors who wanted to devour unwilling targets needed help with their legal strategy, and shareholders 
        needed formal representation. The dollar figures involved were enormous. From the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s, the amount of money involved in mergers and acquisitions every year on Wall Street
