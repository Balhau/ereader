# EReader Utilities

## Introduction

This component is a component whose main purpose is to manage information presented in several (in this case two) ereader platforms. For the most immediate objective is to integrate cybook annotations and statistical information presented in the SQLite database presented in the flash memory and/or sd card that holds the content of the ereader.
